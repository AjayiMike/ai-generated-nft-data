    "name": "Retro Landscape #41",
    "description": "A nostalgic pixel art landscape reminiscent of early 8-bit video games. The scene features a purple gradient sky filled with pixel stars of varying sizes, a bright square sun/moon, and layered mountains creating depth. The foreground includes pixel-textured ground, distinctly purple buildings with glowing windows, stylized green trees, and a central pixel character walking along a path. The entire piece is enhanced with scanlines for an authentic retro CRT monitor effect, evoking the golden era of early computer graphics and gaming.",
