    "name": "Abstract Composition #17",
    "description": "A dynamic abstract composition featuring overlapping geometric shapes with vibrant gradients on a dark background. The design includes a red circle, blue rectangle, and green polygon with smaller yellow, purple, and teal accent circles. White intersecting lines create a structural grid that anchors the composition, while the semi-transparent elements create rich color interactions where they overlap.",
