    "name": "Technical Blueprint #32",
    "description": "A detailed engineering blueprint rendered in luminous cyan and blue lines against a deep navy background. The technical drawing depicts a mechanical mounting plate with precise dimensions, featuring a central hub with concentric circles, corner mounting holes, and complete specification details. The design includes measurement annotations, tolerance information, material specifications, and a formal title block with part number and designer information, replicating the exacting nature of professional engineering documentation.",
